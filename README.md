# Unit 5 - Financial Planning - README
## Overview
This project contains amount of holdings, prices and the value of stocks, bonds and crypto currencies within a portfolio (prices collected by using apis).

It also uses the portfolios holding values and visualizes them in a simple pie chart.

The portfolio is also calculated to see whether savings(portfolio value) are sufficient or not to function as an emergency fund.

## Retirement Planning
Historical stock and bond data is collected and ran through a monte carlo simulation to forecast future returns. 
That monte carlo simulation is then visualised in a 'plot', a distribution plot and finally summarised statisics. The upper and lower confidence intervals are then used to estimate the upper and lower ranges of expected future portfolio value (for both initial investment and 505 increased initial investment).
